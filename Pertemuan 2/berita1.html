   <p>Barcelona midfielder Gavi is said to be “two months” away from returning to full training at the club as he continues his recovery from knee surgery. The latest update comes from reporters Achraf Ben Ayad who posted on X: “Gavi has about two months left to start working with the group.” Gavi has been pictured in the gym this week as he continues his recovery from ACL surgery. The midfielder has been out of action since November when he initially went under the knife and was originally ruled out for “8-10 months.” Gavi’s recovery does appear to be completely on schedule but it also does look as though both the club and the player are in absolutely no hurry for him to return. Previous reports have suggested he could make his comeback in September or October but it could be even later than that. What is certain is that his return will be a massive boost, both on and off the pitch, whenever he does finally get back to doing what he does best.</p>
