                <h1>Gavi back in training</h1>
                Barcelona midfielder Gavi is said to be “two months” away from returning to full training at the
                club as he continues his recovery from knee surgery.

                The latest update comes from reporters Achraf Ben Ayad who posted on X: “Gavi has about two months left
                to
                start working with the group.”

                Gavi has been pictured in the gym this week as he continues his recovery from ACL surgery. The
                midfielder
                has been out of action since November when he initially went under the knife and was originally ruled
                out
                for “8-10 months.”

                Gavi’s recovery does appear to be completely on schedule but it also does look as though both the club
                and
                the player are in absolutely no hurry for him to return.

                Previous reports have suggested he could make his comeback in September or October but it could be even
                later than that.

                What is certain is that his return will be a massive boost, both on and off the pitch, whenever he does
                finally get back to doing what he does best. <br> <a

                <h1>Kembalinya "The Goat" dari cidera</h1>
                Comeback sempurna diperlihatkan Lionel Messi setelah pulih dari cedera saat membela Inter Miami di Major
                League Soccer, Minggu (15/9/2024) pagi WIB. Rekor bersejarah MLS seketika dipecahkan La Pulga.

                Diketahui, Messi terhitung hampir dua bulan lamanya absen memperkuat Inter Miami gegara cedera.

                Messi mengalami cedera lanjutan pada pergelangan kaki setelah membawa Argentina juara Copa America 2024,
